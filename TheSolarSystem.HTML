    <h1>The solar system</h1>
    <p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The largest of such objects are the eight planets.

<h3>The order of the planets</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Mercury</li>
    <li>Venus</li>
    <li>Earth</li>
    <li>Mars</li>
    <li>Jupiter</li>
    <li>Saturn</li>
    <li>Uranus</li>
    <li>Neptune</li> </ol>
    <h3>Mercury</h3> <img src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/c6f7cee9-cde6-44a2-a686-9a80f5bfc1e8/01_mercury_pia15190_orig.jpg" width="100" height="100">
    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It's a little bigger than Earth's Moon and it is the closest planet to the Sun.</p>
    
    <h3>Venus</h3> <img align="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/PIA23791-Venus-NewlyProcessedView-20200608.jpg/800px-PIA23791-Venus-NewlyProcessedView-20200608.jpg"width="100" height="100">
    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. Its thick atmosphere is full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and it has clouds of sulfuric acid.</p>
    
    <h3> Earth</h3> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yCPyoZDQBBcXikqxkeW2jJ-1200-80.jpg" width="100" height="100"
    <br></br>
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the universe where life has originated and found habitability. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water.</p>
    
    <h3>Mars</h3> <img align="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Mars_-_August_30_2021_-_Flickr_-_Kevin_M._Gill.png" width="100" height="100"
    <br>
    <p>Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground. Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.</p>
    
    <h3>Jupiter</h3> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Jupiter_New_Horizons.jpg" width="100" height="100"
    <br>
    <p>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got big enough to start burning. Jupiter is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years.</p>

    <h3>Saturn</h3> <img align="right" src="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/cloud/timeoutdubai/2023/01/18/saturn.jpg" width="100" height="100">
    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons.</p>

    <h3>Uranus</h3> <img src="https://solarstory.net/img/articles/big/planet-uranus-by-voyager-2-in-1986.jpg" width="100" height="70">
    <p>The seventh planet from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit.</p>
    
    <h3>Neptune</h3> <img align="right" src="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/neptune" width="100" height="100">
    <p>Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small, rocky core. Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.</p>
